Cloudy with a Chance of Servers
===================
### A guide to getting started with “the cloud”. 
#### Author: Sumukh Sridhara (@sumukhsridhara)

A workshop intended for those who are new to using web server/"the cloud". 


What will this workshop cover:

1. Quick overview of the cloud (DNS, Servers, ETC)
2. How to get started with the cloud by launching a server (say on DigitalOcean). 
3. Let’s use apache to server up a webpage. 
4. Modify the pages, maybe install a personal website
5. Quickly modify the config to change an error file
6. Now let’s use something much better: Nginx. 
7. Use Nginx to serve up the page. Do a quick speed test or load test.
8. Let’s talk about AWS. What is the benefit of AWS (What do you use it for? etc)
9. Example of launching servers, using SSH authentication. S3 is for file storage. CDN 
10. What else can you do? Configure subdomains with DNS. Setup an email server. Use the server as backup. 
11. Let’s talk maintenance & keeping the server up. Scaling. NewRelic monitoring, Pingdom. How do you ensure your site stays up and fast. Use a CDN
12. By the end of the workshop you'll have a website deployed on your very own VPS.


### Prereqs.
1. An account at DigitalOcean (or a similiar VPS provider)
  1. You might need a credit-card for DigitalOcean but you can use promocodes to get $10 of credit - 2 months of a server. These were valid at the time of writing: SSD2014 and OMGSSD10
2. Terminal if your are on OSX or Putty if you are Windows. 
  1. Windows: You can [install Putty here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
  2. Windows: Connect on SSH over port 22

### Copy Pasta. 
I'll include what you need to copy & paste here and you can see my notes if you want to get ahead.


### Things to experiment with later
* Install MySQL and use it.
* Play with PHP.
* Install Varnish to make your site even faster.
* Install python or node.js or Ruby/Ruby On Rails
* Install wordpress or a blogging platform
* Try load-testing your server.
* Setup a Domain with your site.
